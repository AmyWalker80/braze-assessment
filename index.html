            <h1>The Audience Paths Component</h1>
            <div class="lesson-description">
                <p>Send users down different journeys based on their attributes
                    and preferences using the audience paths component.</p>
            </div>

                    <h3>Audience Paths</h3>
                    <p>With audience paths, you'll send users down different
                        journeys based on their attributes and preferences.
                        You’ll define up to 7 audience groups. “Everyone Else”
                        is an additional fallback group for any users who do not
                        meet the criteria for the other groupings.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Ranking</h3>
                    <p>Audience paths rank your different groupings, so that if
                        a user falls into multiple audience groups, they’ll go
                        down the path designated as the highest priority.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

                <h3>Use Case 1</h3>
                <p>Tailor messages to users based on their country of residency.</p>

            <div class="use-case-2">
                <h3>Use Case 2</h3>
                <p>Provide restaurant recommendations based on a user’s past
                    orders, using multiple audience paths to hone in on your
                    user’s favorite cuisine.</p>

                <h3>Use Case 3</h3>
                <p>Assign priority to messages targeting more granular user
                    preference data. For example, users who like a big brand’s
                    shoes will receive a message with shoe recommendations,
                    while users who have only expressed interest in the brand
                    more generally will receive recommendations for a mixture of
                    products.</p>
